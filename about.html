      <title>ABOUT US</title>
      <p>
        Ford is a family company, one that spans the globe and has shared
        ideals. We value service to each other and the world as much as to our
        customers. Generations have made their memories with us and included us
        in their hopes and dreams. After 117 years, we’re used to adapting to
        and leading change. That’s why we’re evolving to focus on services,
        experiences and software as well as vehicles.

      <h3>OUR HISTORY</h3>
      <p>
        Henry Ford transformed not only the automobile but working life and the
        role of transportation. Having played our part in everything from the
        birth of the middle class to the recent global pandemic, we serve the
        world with integrity and competence. The Blue Oval is one of the most
        recognized corporate symbols in history, continually striving to earn
        the trust of all stakeholders.
